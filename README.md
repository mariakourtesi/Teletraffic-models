# Teletraffic Loss Models
This repository contains implementations of mathematical formulas related to teletraffic loss models, as described in the book Efficient Multirate Teletraffic Loss Models.

These models are commonly used in the field of telecommunications and beyond to analyse and optimise performance, particularly in scenarios involving multirate traffic and varying levels of service demand.
