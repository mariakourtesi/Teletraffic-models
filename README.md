# Teletraffic Loss Models

This repository contains implementations of mathematical formulas related to teletraffic loss models, as described in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Efficient-Multirate-Teletraffic-Models-Beyond/dp/111942688X" target="_blank"> Efficient Multirate Teletraffic Loss Models Beyond Erlang.</a>


These models are commonly used in the field of telecommunications and beyond to analyse and optimise performance, particularly in scenarios involving multirate traffic and varying levels of service demand.

It also includes the implementation of the proposed analytic model, which calculates blocking probabilities in a cloud system offering IaaS, as described in the paper  <a href="[https://readme.com/](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483923)" target="_blank">A Multiparameter Analytical Model of the Physical Infrastructure of a Cloud-Based System<a>
