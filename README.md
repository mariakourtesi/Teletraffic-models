# Teletraffic Loss Models
This repository contains implementations of mathematical formulas related to teletraffic loss models, as described in the book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Efficient-Multirate-Teletraffic-Models-Beyond/dp/111942688X" target="_blank"> Efficient Multirate Teletraffic Loss Models Beyond Erlang.</a>


These models are commonly used in the field of telecommunications and beyond to analyse and optimise performance, particularly in scenarios involving multirate traffic and varying levels of service demand.
