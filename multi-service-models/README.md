# Multirate Loss Models

## Description
This project implements various mathematical models related to network optimization and performance analysis, 
it also implements the proposed analytic model, which calculates blocking probabilities in a cloud system offering IaaS, as described in the paper  <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9483923" target="_blank">A Multiparameter Analytical Model of the Physical Infrastructure of a Cloud-Based System<a>

These formulas are widely used in telecommunications and network engineering to address challenges such as traffic management, resource allocation, and network dimensioning.

Each directory /formulas/* contains its own README with more information about each mathematical model.
